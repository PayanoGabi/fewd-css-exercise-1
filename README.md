# CSS Exercise 1

  * Make a copy of `css-history.html` and name it `firstname-lastname.html` (e.g tom-kraak.html.)
  * View the document locally in your favorite browser.

## Style

  * Create a stylesheet document and name it `firstname-lastname.css`. Make sure you are in your repo.
  * Wire up your CSS file as an external stylesheet for the HTML document you created above.
  * Use a [tag selector](http://fewd.betamore.com/slides/unit/4/#16) to color the headline [red](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/).
  * Use an [ID selector](http://fewd.betamore.com/slides/unit/4/#14) to color the very first list item [green](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/).
  * Use a [class selector](http://fewd.betamore.com/slides/unit/4/#15) to set all dates/years to bold and italic.
  * Use a [child selector](http://fewd.betamore.com/slides/unit/4/#17) to color the `Font information can be used to download font subsets over the Web` list item [pink](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/).
  * Use a [descendant selector](http://fewd.betamore.com/slides/unit/4/#18) to give all `<blockquotes>` a [gray](http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/) background color.
  * **BONUS:** Set the entire document in a `sans-serif` [font](http://fontcdn.org/) and sensible `line-height` of your choosing.
